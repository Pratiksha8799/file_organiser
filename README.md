# ðŸŽ¯Folder Organizer:

This project is a simple file organizer that automatically categorizes and moves files from the user's Downloads folder into designated subfolders based on their file type. It helps keep the Downloads folder organized by placing files into specific folders such as Images, PDFs, Documents, etc.

## ðŸŽ¯Features:


1. Automatically detects and organizes files in the Downloads folder.

2. Move files into designated folders based on their file extension.

3. Creates folders dynamically if they don't exist.

4. Handles common file types such as images, documents, videos, music, archives, and more.

5. Places unrecognized file types in an "Others" folder.

## ðŸŽ¯Technologies Used:


* Python: Core programming language.
* os: Used for file and folder management.
* shutil: Used to move files from one directory to another.

## ðŸŽ¯Setup and Execution:
* Set Up Environment: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

* Download the Script: Save the Python script as quick_organiser.py.

* Run the Script:
    Open a terminal or command prompt.
    Navigate to the folder where the script is saved.
    Execute the script using the following command.
    ```
    py quick_organiser.py
    ```
    

## ðŸŽ¯Common Errors:

* File In Use:
If a file is currently open in another application, trying to move it may result in a "file in use" error.
* Permission Error:
If the script does not have permission to create folders or move files in the Downloads directory, it may throw a permission error.
## ðŸŽ¯Used By:

* Students: Students who download course materials, research papers, and assignments can keep their downloads tidy.
* Professionals: Professionals who deal with various file types in their daily work can maintain an organized workspace.
* Content Creators: Bloggers, photographers, and video editors can manage their assets efficiently.


## ðŸŽ¯Future Enhancements:

* Additional File Types:
Add more file extensions to the destinations dictionary to accommodate other file types.

* Customizable Folder Paths:
Allow users to specify custom folders (e.g., Desktop or Documents) instead of just organizing the Downloads folder.

* Logging:
Implement logging for better monitoring of moved files, errors, or exceptions.
##  ðŸŽ¯Conclusion

The script will automatically create the necessary subfolders in the Downloads directory (if they donâ€™t already exist).
It will then scan the files in the Downloads folder and move them to their respective subfolders based on their file type.
